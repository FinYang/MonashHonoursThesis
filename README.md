MonashThesis
===============

This repository provides a template for a Monash University Honours thesis using Rmarkdown with the bookdown package. It is designed for Honours students in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics, but can be modified for other departments and other universities as required. It is based on a [similar template for PhD students](https://github.com/robjhyndman/MonashThesis).

## Requirements

To set up the software, you will need to install a few R packages and LaTeX. This can be done within R as follows.

```r
install.packages('bookdown')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```
